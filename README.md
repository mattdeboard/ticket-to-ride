# ttr

A Clojure implementation of the board game [Ticket to Ride](http://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/usa/overview/).

## Why?

Ticket to Ride (ttr) is basically a board game about graph traversal. I've been curious about graph databases and the like for awhile and decided this would be a good context to look into them. I wound up settling on [Neo4j Community Edition](http://www.neo4j.org/download).
